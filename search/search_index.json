The Fields section shows all fields found in the uploaded data and the default settings, that the system determines after the import. You can redefine the following fields. Fields Description Column name The column name is the name found in the imported file, it cannot be changed Label Label used in the plots and in tooltips. this will be more useful in future versions. The Piper plots uses fixed labels to label the ternary endpoints. Digits Number of digits for numeric parameters when shown in a tooltip. Map Columns may be mapped to system parameters, so the application understands the sgnificance of the data held in this column. Currently the following system parameters can be mapped: latitude, longitude, sample_date, ca, mg, k, cl, so4, hco3, co3, alk. Note that if you use these names as your column names in the uploaded file, the system will detect and map the paramters automatically. Type Data type for this column: str, float, int, datetime. String parameters will appear in the interface as filters and you will also be able to use them for the legend in the plot. The Generate time aggregation columns only appears, if a parameter has been mapped as the sample_date parameter. If this is the case, you may add one or multiple time aggregation columns: Year , Month , Season . Teese fields can later be used for filtering or as the legend in a Piper plot. A simplified algorithm is used where December to February are assigned to Winter, March to May to spring, June to August to summer and September to November to fall. Note that for dtermining the season based on the sampling date, you should define the hemisphere of the project area.
